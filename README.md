TypeScript/JavaScript utility functions I commonly use

## Ideas

- All files with "common" export names should maybe make them slightly more specific.
- Standardise on storing data (colours, vectors, matrices) as arrays (rather than named objects).
- Is wrap() functionally mod?
- Add an array helper using wrap() for indices.
- More tests.
- LeftPad, CenterPad?, RightPad.
- Standardize to US english.
- Autogenerate docs.
